##ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING##

##This repository contains programs created for the ALX Software Engineering Programs. Your girl here is ready for collaborations, Currently sharpening my knowledge and skills of C, Linux, Algorithms and Data Structures. Hey you! Come let's do hard things.This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track in the ALX Software Engineering Program. In these projects I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C programming language. The following is a specific list of projects :

0x00-hello_world
0x01-variables_if_else_while
0x02-functions_nested_loops
0x03-debugging
0x04-more_functions_nested_loops
0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
0x06-pointers_arrays_strings
0x07-pointers_arrays_strings
0x08-recursion
0x09-static_libraries
0x0A-argc_argv
0x0B-malloc_free
0x0C-more_malloc_free
0x0D-preprocessor
0x0E-structures_typedef
0x0F-function_pointers
0x10-variadic_functions
0x12-singly_linked_lists
0x13-more_singly_linked_lists
0x14-bit_manipulation
0x15-file_io
0x17-doubly_linked_lists
0x18-dynamic_libraries
